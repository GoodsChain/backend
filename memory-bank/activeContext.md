# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Implementation of customer, supplier, car, and customer-car management APIs with full CRUD operations following Clean Architecture principles.

## Recent Changes
1. Implemented unit tests for customer_usecase.go using Uber's GoMock
2. Added mock generation for CustomerRepository and CustomerUsecase interfaces
3. Created new Makefile commands for mock generation and test execution
4. Achieved 100% test coverage for usecase layer
5. Implemented comprehensive unit tests for customer_handler.go with table-driven tests
6. Implemented unit tests for customer_repository.go using go-sqlmock
7. Implemented complete CRUD API for supplier management following the same architecture
8. Added unit tests for supplier across all layers (repository, usecase, handler)
9. Updated router to include supplier endpoints
10. Implemented graceful shutdown handling in main.go
11. Added proper database connection cleanup during shutdown
12. Configured HTTP server with appropriate timeouts
13. Added validation tags to `model.Customer` and `model.Supplier` for required fields (Name, Address, Email) and email format.
14. Updated `CreateCustomer` and `UpdateCustomer` handlers (and corresponding supplier handlers) to leverage Gin's `ShouldBindJSON` for automatic request body validation.
15. Removed redundant manual validation checks from handlers.
16. Updated handler unit tests (`customer_handler_test.go`, `supplier_handler_test.go`) to cover various input validation scenarios (success, missing fields, invalid formats).
17. Implemented a global error handling middleware (`handler.ErrorHandlingMiddleware`) to standardize JSON error responses.
18. Implemented structured logging using `zerolog` library, including request logging (method, path, status, latency, IP) and error logging in the `ErrorHandlingMiddleware`. Logger is initialized in `main.go` via a new `logger` package, with log level configurable via `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.
19. Implemented API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI with `swaggo`. This includes:
    - Added `swaggo/gin-swagger`, `swaggo/files`, and `swaggo/swag` dependencies.
    - Annotated `main.go` with general API information.
    - Annotated model structs (`Customer`, `Supplier`, `ErrorResponse`, `SuccessResponse`) with examples and descriptions.
    - Annotated handler functions in `customer_handler.go` and `supplier_handler.go` for all CRUD operations.
    - Added a `/swagger/*any` route in `main.go` to serve the Swagger UI.
    - Standardized error responses in handlers to use `model.ErrorResponse`.
20. Implemented CRUD APIs for Car management. This involved:
    - Defining the `Car` model (`model/car.go`) based on the existing database schema.
    - Implementing `CarRepository` (`repository/car_repository.go`) with PostgreSQL logic and unit tests (`repository/car_repository_test.go`) using `go-sqlmock`.
    - Implementing `CarUsecase` (`usecase/car_usecase.go`) with business logic and unit tests (`usecase/car_usecase_test.go`) using `MockCarRepository`.
    - Implementing `CarHandler` (`handler/car_handler.go`) with Gin handlers, Swagger annotations, and unit tests (`handler/car_handler_test.go`) using `MockCarUsecase`.
    - Generating mocks for `CarRepository` and `CarUsecase` and updating the `Makefile`.
    - Adding car routes to `handler/router.go`.
    - Integrating car components into `main.go`.
    - Updating Swagger documentation with `swag init`.
21. Implemented CRUD APIs for CustomerCar (many-to-many relationship) management. This involved:
    - Defining the `CustomerCar` model in `model/customer_car.go` to represent the customer-car relationship
    - Implementing `CustomerCarRepository` in `repository/customer_car_repository.go` with methods for Create, GetByID, GetAll, GetByCustomerID, GetByCarID, Update, and Delete
    - Implementing `CustomerCarUsecase` in `usecase/customer_car_usecase.go` with business logic including UUID generation
    - Creating `CustomerCarHandler` in `handler/customer_car_handler.go` with RESTful endpoints and Swagger documentation
    - Generating mocks for `CustomerCarRepository` and `CustomerCarUsecase` interfaces
    - Adding specialized endpoints in `router.go` for:
      - `/customer-cars` - standard CRUD operations for the relationship
      - `/customers/:customer_id/cars` - retrieving cars by customer ID
      - `/cars/:car_id/customers` - retrieving customers by car ID
    - Updating `main.go` to initialize and connect the customer-car components
22. Created comprehensive README.md with:
    - Project overview and features
    - Architecture explanation
    - Complete API endpoint documentation
    - Technology stack details
    - Setup and configuration instructions
    - Testing procedures overview
    - Project structure documentation

5. ✅ Implement error handling middleware
6. ✅ Add structured logging implementation
7. ✅ Add documentation for API endpoints
8. ✅ All core features from project brief implemented.
9. ✅ Implemented Car CRUD API as per new request.
10. ✅ Implemented CustomerCar CRUD API for managing the many-to-many relationship between customers and cars.
11. ✅ Created comprehensive project README.md
12. Awaiting new feature requests or refinements.
13. Consider implementing unit tests for the CustomerCar components.

## Active Decisions
1. Using singular table name 'customer' instead of 'customers' in database queries
2. Keeping handler layer thin with minimal business logic
3. Using interface-based design for loose coupling between layers
4. Implementing dependency injection for testability
5. Using Uber's GoMock for mocking dependencies in unit tests
6. Using go-sqlmock for repository layer testing without requiring a real database
7. Implementing graceful shutdown with a 30-second timeout for server shutdown
8. Using goroutines for non-blocking server startup to allow signal handling
9. Separating graceful shutdown logic into a dedicated function for better organization and maintainability
10. Using Gin's built-in validation (`ShouldBindJSON` with struct tags like `binding:"required,email"`) for request payload validation, ensuring data integrity at the entry point.
11. Implemented a global error handling middleware to catch errors from `c.Errors` and format them as `{\"error\": \"message\"}`. It also attempts to provide a JSON response for 404s.
12. Adopted `zerolog` for structured logging due to its performance and ease of use. Configured console output for development and made log level configurable via the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable. Centralized request and error logging within the `ErrorHandlingMiddleware`.
13. Adopted `swaggo/swag` and `swaggo/gin-swagger` for generating OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation due to its popularity and ease of integration with Gin.
14. Standardized API documentation by annotating handlers, models, and main application entry point.
15. Created common `model.ErrorResponse` and `model.SuccessResponse` structs for consistent API responses and Swagger documentation.
16. Ensured new Car CRUD API implementation followed the same Clean Architecture patterns, testing strategies, and error handling conventions established for Customer and Supplier APIs.
17. For the CustomerCar relationship, created specialized endpoints to easily retrieve cars by customer ID and customers by car ID, improving API usability.
18. Created a comprehensive README.md with detailed documentation on architecture, endpoints, technologies, and setup instructions to improve project usability and onboarding experience.

## Project Insights
1. Current implementation follows Clean Architecture with clear separation of concerns
2. Error handling is consistent across layers
3. Database interactions are properly encapsulated in repository layer
4. API endpoints follow RESTful conventions with appropriate HTTP methods and status codes
5. Usecase layer has complete test coverage demonstrating loose coupling with repository layer
6. Repository tests verify SQL queries match implementation expectations
7. Server implements proper graceful shutdown allowing in-flight requests to complete
8. Resource cleanup is handled properly during shutdown (database connections)
9. Graceful shutdown is now modularized in a dedicated function improving code organization
10. Input validation is now implemented for customer and supplier creation/update endpoints, enhancing API robustness and data integrity by ensuring required fields are present and formats (like email) are correct before processing.
11. The new error handling middleware centralizes error response formatting, improving API consistency and maintainability.
12. Structured logging provides detailed, machine-readable logs for requests and errors, significantly improving observability and debugging capabilities.
13. The addition of Swagger API documentation significantly improves the usability and discoverability of the API for developers and consumers.
14. Standardized response models (`ErrorResponse`, `SuccessResponse`) enhance API consistency.
15. The established Clean Architecture and modular design facilitated the addition of new CRUD APIs (e.g., for Car) with relative ease and consistency.
16. The implementation of the CustomerCar module demonstrated how to handle many-to-many relationships in a Clean Architecture context, with clear separation of concerns and a focus on relation-specific operations (GetByCustomerID, GetByCarID).
17. The routing design provides both entity-centric access (through the `/customer-cars` endpoints) and relationship-centric access (through `/customers/:customer_id/cars` and `/cars/:car_id/customers`), offering flexibility in how data can be retrieved.
18. The comprehensive README.md now serves as an entry point to the project, providing clear documentation on system capabilities, architecture, setup instructions, and API usage, which will significantly improve developer onboarding and project maintainability.
