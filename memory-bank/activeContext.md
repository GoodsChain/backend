# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Implementation of customer and supplier management APIs with full CRUD operations following Clean Architecture principles.

## Recent Changes
1. Implemented unit tests for customer_usecase.go using Uber's GoMock
2. Added mock generation for CustomerRepository and CustomerUsecase interfaces
3. Created new Makefile commands for mock generation and test execution
4. Achieved 100% test coverage for usecase layer
5. Implemented comprehensive unit tests for customer_handler.go with table-driven tests
6. Implemented unit tests for customer_repository.go using go-sqlmock
7. Implemented complete CRUD API for supplier management following the same architecture
8. Added unit tests for supplier across all layers (repository, usecase, handler)
9. Updated router to include supplier endpoints

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Implement unit tests for handler layer
2. ✅ Implement unit tests for repository layer
3. Add input validation for all endpoints
4. Implement error handling middleware
5. Add structured logging implementation

## Active Decisions
1. Using singular table name 'customer' instead of 'customers' in database queries
2. Keeping handler layer thin with minimal business logic
3. Using interface-based design for loose coupling between layers
4. Implementing dependency injection for testability
5. Using Uber's GoMock for mocking dependencies in unit tests
6. Using go-sqlmock for repository layer testing without requiring a real database

## Project Insights
1. Current implementation follows Clean Architecture with clear separation of concerns
2. Error handling is consistent across layers
3. Database interactions are properly encapsulated in repository layer
4. API endpoints follow RESTful conventions with appropriate HTTP methods and status codes
5. Usecase layer has complete test coverage demonstrating loose coupling with repository layer
6. Repository tests verify SQL queries match implementation expectations
