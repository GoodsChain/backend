# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Implementation of customer management API with full CRUD operations following Clean Architecture principles.

## Recent Changes
1. Implemented unit tests for customer_usecase.go using Uber's GoMock
2. Added mock generation for CustomerRepository interface
3. Created new Makefile commands for mock generation and test execution
4. Achieved 100% test coverage for usecase layer

## Next Steps
1. Implement unit tests for handler layer
2. Implement unit tests for repository layer
3. Add input validation for all endpoints
4. Implement error handling middleware
5. Add structured logging implementation

## Active Decisions
1. Using singular table name 'customer' instead of 'customers' in database queries
2. Keeping handler layer thin with minimal business logic
3. Using interface-based design for loose coupling between layers
4. Implementing dependency injection for testability
5. Using Uber's GoMock for mocking dependencies in unit tests

## Project Insights
1. Current implementation follows Clean Architecture with clear separation of concerns
2. Error handling is consistent across layers
3. Database interactions are properly encapsulated in repository layer
4. API endpoints follow RESTful conventions with appropriate HTTP methods and status codes
5. Usecase layer has complete test coverage demonstrating loose coupling with repository layer
