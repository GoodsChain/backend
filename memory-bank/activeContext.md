# Active Context

## Current Focus

We've recently enhanced the GoodsChain backend system with several key improvements to make it more robust, configurable, and maintainable:

1. **Enhanced Configuration System**
   - Added comprehensive configuration parameters with intelligent defaults
   - Implemented connection pooling configuration
   - Added validation and detailed logging of configuration values
   - Changed to use the GetDSN() method for cleaner database connection string generation

2. **API Structure Improvements**
   - Implemented API versioning with router groups (e.g., `/v1/customers`)
   - Added health check endpoint at root level for monitoring
   - Updated router structure to use gin.IRouter interface for flexibility
   - Cleaned up middleware organization

3. **Structured Error Handling**
   - Created a dedicated errors package with standardized error types
   - Implemented error codes for better client-side handling
   - Updated error responses to follow a consistent structure
   - Enhanced error middleware to properly classify and log errors

4. **Observability Enhancements**
   - Added request ID tracking across the system
   - Improved logging with structured fields using zerolog
   - Enhanced log context with request-specific information
   - Better classification of log levels based on HTTP status codes

5. **Database Refinements**
   - Fixed the `updated_by` column size in the `customer_car` table
   - Added migration scripts for the database fix
   - Configured connection pooling for better performance under load
   - Added connection lifetime management

6. **Updated Documentation**
   - Updated Swagger definitions to match API changes
   - Updated README to reflect new features and configuration options
   - Added more detailed API endpoint documentation

## Active Decisions

- Using API versioning to allow for future API changes without breaking existing clients
- Implementing a robust error handling system with standardized error codes
- Enhancing observability with request IDs and structured logging
- Using a request ID to track requests through the system for better troubleshooting
- Adding more configuration options with sensible defaults for easier deployment

## Important Patterns

- Clean separation of concerns between layers (handler, usecase, repository)
- Consistent error handling and propagation across layers
- Standardized middleware pattern for request processing
- Structured logging with context information
- Connection pooling for database performance

## Recent Learnings

- Importance of proper error classification and standardization
- Benefits of request tracking for observability
- Value of comprehensive configuration with sensible defaults
- Importance of API versioning for long-term maintenance
- Benefits of graceful shutdown with configurable timeouts
