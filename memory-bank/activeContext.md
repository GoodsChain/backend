# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Implementation of customer management API with full CRUD operations following Clean Architecture principles.

## Recent Changes
1. Added GET /customers endpoint to retrieve all customers
2. Implemented GetAll method in repository layer
3. Added GetAllCustomers method in usecase layer
4. Updated router to handle the new endpoint

## Next Steps
1. Implement remaining CRUD operations if not already implemented
2. Add input validation for all endpoints
3. Implement error handling middleware
4. Add structured logging implementation
5. Create unit tests for all layers

## Active Decisions
1. Using singular table name 'customer' instead of 'customers' in database queries
2. Keeping handler layer thin with minimal business logic
3. Using interface-based design for loose coupling between layers
4. Implementing dependency injection for testability

## Project Insights
1. Current implementation follows Clean Architecture with clear separation of concerns
2. Error handling is consistent across layers
3. Database interactions are properly encapsulated in repository layer
4. API endpoints follow RESTful conventions with appropriate HTTP methods and status codes
