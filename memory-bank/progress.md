# Project Progress

## What Works
1. All CRUD operations are implemented (including the newly added GET /customers)
2. Clean Architecture layers are properly separated and functioning
3. Database integration with PostgreSQL is working correctly
4. API endpoints are accessible and returning appropriate responses
5. Dependency injection is properly implemented
6. Unit tests for usecase layer with 100% coverage using Uber's GoMock
7. Unit tests for handler layer with table-driven tests covering all endpoints

## What's Left to Build
1. Input validation for all endpoints
2. Error handling middleware for consistent error responses
3. Structured logging implementation
4. Unit tests for repository layer
5. Documentation for API endpoints

## Current Status
The core functionality for customer management is complete and working. The system follows Clean Architecture principles with proper separation of concerns. All database interactions are encapsulated in the repository layer, business logic is handled in the usecase layer, and HTTP routing is managed in the handler layer. Both the usecase and handler layers now have comprehensive unit tests with complete test coverage using table-driven tests and mock implementations.

## Known Issues
1. No comprehensive error handling middleware yet
2. Lack of structured logging implementation
3. No input validation for API endpoints
4. Missing unit tests for repository layer

## Evolution of Decisions
1. Decided to use singular table names in database queries to match actual schema
2. Maintained thin handler layer to ensure business logic remains in usecase layer
3. Implemented interface-based design for better testability and loose coupling
4. Selected Uber's GoMock for creating mock implementations in unit tests
5. Added dedicated Makefile commands for testing and mock generation
