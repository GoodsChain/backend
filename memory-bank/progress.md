# Project Progress

## What Works
1. All CRUD operations for customers are implemented (including the newly added GET /customers)
2. All CRUD operations for suppliers are implemented with full endpoint coverage
3. Clean Architecture layers are properly separated and functioning
4. Database integration with PostgreSQL is working correctly
5. API endpoints are accessible and returning appropriate responses
6. Dependency injection is properly implemented
7. Unit tests for usecase layer with 100% coverage using Uber's GoMock
8. Unit tests for handler layer with table-driven tests covering all endpoints
9. Unit tests for repository layer with go-sqlmock simulating database interactions

## What's Left to Build
1. Input validation for all endpoints
2. Error handling middleware for consistent error responses
3. Structured logging implementation
4. Documentation for API endpoints

## Current Status
The core functionality for both customer and supplier management is complete and working. The system follows Clean Architecture principles with proper separation of concerns. All database interactions are encapsulated in the repository layer, business logic is handled in the usecase layer, and HTTP routing is managed in the handler layer. All layers now have comprehensive unit tests with complete test coverage using appropriate testing strategies - table-driven tests for handlers, mocks for usecases, and go-sqlmock for repositories. The supplier API implementation follows the same architectural patterns as the customer API, ensuring consistency across the codebase.

## Known Issues
1. No comprehensive error handling middleware yet
2. Lack of structured logging implementation
3. No input validation for API endpoints

## Evolution of Decisions
1. Decided to use singular table names in database queries to match actual schema
2. Maintained thin handler layer to ensure business logic remains in usecase layer
3. Implemented interface-based design for better testability and loose coupling
4. Selected Uber's GoMock for creating mock implementations in unit tests
5. Added dedicated Makefile commands for testing and mock generation
6. Used go-sqlmock for repository testing to avoid real database dependencies
7. Created mock repositories using 'make mock' command for usecase testing
8. Applied consistent architectural patterns across different domain entities (customers and suppliers)
